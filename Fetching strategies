The thing to notice in the @ManyToMany annotation is how we configure the 
fetching strategy, which can be lazy or eager. In this case, we've set 
the fetch to EAGER, so that when we retrieve a SuperHero from the 
database, we'll also automatically retrieve all of its corresponding 
Movies.

If we chose to perform a LAZY fetch instead, we would only retrieve each 
Movie as it was specifically accessed. Lazy fetching is only possible 
while the SuperHero is attached to the EntityManager; otherwise 
accessing a superhero's movies will throw an exception. We want to be 
able to access a superhero's movies on demand, so in this case we 
choose the EAGER fetching strategy.
